Install purrr 1.0.0 with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
pak::pak("cran/purrr@1.0.0")
```

Load the package with:

```{r}
#| message: false
library(purrr)
```

## `keep_at()` and `discard_at()`

purrr has two functions, `keep()` and `discard()`, that keep/discard elements by value:

::: panel-tabset
## `keep()`

```{r}
rep(10, 10) |>
  map(sample, 5) |>
  keep(function(x) mean(x) > 6)
```

## `discard()`

```{r}
rep(10, 10) |>
  map(sample, 5) |>
  discard(function(x) mean(x) > 6)
```
:::

purrr has two new functions, `keep_at()` and `discard_at()`, that work like `keep()` and `discard()` but operate on names rather than values:

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, D = 4, E = 5)

x |> 
  keep_at(c("a", "b", "c")) |> 
  str()
```

```{r}
x |> 
  discard_at(c("a", "b", "c")) |> 
  str()
```

Or, you can provide a logical vector

```{r}
is_lower_case <- function(x) x == tolower(x)

x |> keep_at(is_lower_case)
```
