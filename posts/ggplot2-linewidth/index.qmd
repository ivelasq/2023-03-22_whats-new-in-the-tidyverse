## What is ggplot2?

{ggplot2} is a system for creating elegant graphics based on The Grammar of Graphics.

## What is new?

ggplot 3.4.0 has been released. Install it with:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

`linewidth` will take over sizing of the width of lines - something that was  handled previously by `size`.

## Before

```{r}
#| include: false
new_lib <- tempfile()
dir.create(new_lib)

withr::with_libpaths(new = new_lib,
                     install.packages("remotes"))
withr::with_libpaths(new = new_lib,
                     remotes::install_version("ggplot2", "3.3.6"))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2,
        lib.loc = new_lib)

ggplot(airquality) +
  geom_line(aes(Day, Temp, size = Month, group = Month)) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 3))
```

```{r}
#| include: false
unlink(new_lib, recursive = TRUE)
unloadNamespace("ggplot2")
```

## After

```{r}
#| include: false
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality) + 
  geom_line(aes(Day, Temp, linewidth = Month, group = Month)) + 
  scale_linewidth(range = c(0.5, 3))
```

:::

You will get a deprecation message if you try to use `size` when you should be using `linewidth`.

```{r}
ggplot(airquality) + 
  geom_line(aes(Day, Temp, size = Month, group = Month)) + 
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 3))
```
